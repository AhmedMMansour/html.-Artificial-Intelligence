Scientists and researchers are working to develop future artificial intelligence that can be greatly beneficial and in multiple aspects of life; Starting from smart phones, to cars, or even homes that operate on the smart system, Here are some future scenarios that artificial intelligence systems may reach in different fields:
<br> 
<h3>Entertainment:</h3> People may be able to watch a movie that they choose their actors, And artificial intelligence systems may also assist production companies to analyze the scenario of a particular film and anticipate the profits that the film might earn when it is shown in cinemas.
<br>
<h3>Medical care:</h3> It is expected that future artificial intelligence systems can provide superior medical care for humans, by providing special care for each patient according to his genes, lifestyle and environment, which helps diagnose brain tumors, and treat cancer appropriate for each patient.
<br>
<h3>Data and information security:</h3> future AI systems are expected to be able to protect people's data from theft and penetration.
<br>
<h3>Daily life:</h3> Future intelligence systems will play a large role in carrying out many of the vital daily tasks that a person needs, such as caring for the elderly, taking them into consideration permanently, accomplishing household chores and many other actions that one system of artificial intelligence will be able to do together, and artificial intelligence systems will A major role in performing potentially hazardous actions such as firefighting and mine clearance.
<br>
<h3>Means of transportation:</h3> It is expected that in the future autonomous cars will be reached entirely, so that the driver can do anything else and leave the driving to the artificial intelligence systems available in his car, and it must be noted that the autonomous cars are already present today, but they are It will be available and widely available in the future.
